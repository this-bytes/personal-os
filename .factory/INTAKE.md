# Intake — wants, and how they become work

The factory loop in [FACTORY.md](../FACTORY.md) starts at intake. This file is
the intake queue: the wants that have been said out loud and have not yet
become work items.

Chat is where wants arrive. This file is where they are remembered. If a want
is not written here, the factory has not heard it — the same rule as
FACTORY.md: the repository is the state.

A **want** is a request in the owner's words. A **work item** is something one
owner can implement and someone else can verify. Most wants are not work
items. Some are already shipped. Some are three work items. Some are wrong.
Intake is where that is discovered, before anyone spends an hour on it.

## The queue

Empty until the owner says something. A want is written here in the owner's
own words, not a summary of them.

| #   | Want                    | Said | Verdict |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| —   | _no wants recorded yet_ | —    | —       |

Verdicts: `open` — not yet judged. `accepted` — became a work item, cited
here. `declined` — not doing it, with the reason kept. `folded` — already
covered by an existing work item.

## Candidates

Gaps Chief found in the repository. These are **not** wants. They are
possibilities, and they become work only when the owner picks one or asks for
something that leads to it. Each names where it was seen.

## How a want becomes a work item

1. **Record it in the owner's words.** Not a paraphrase. The owner's phrasing
   often carries the real requirement, and the paraphrase is where it gets
   lost.
2. **Judge it.** Is it worth doing at all? Is it already shipped? Is it a
   duplicate of an open work item? Answer that here, in one line.
3. **Sharpen it with the standing questions.** Only the ones whose answers
   change the work. A question that does not change the work item is noise.
4. **Split it.** One owner per work item. A want that needs two owners is two
   work items (FACTORY.md).
5. **Write the work item** in `.factory/work/WI-NNN.md`, in the format of
   [TASK.md](TASK.md). The acceptance criteria are written so that someone who
   has not read the diff could check them.
6. **Or decline it**, with the reason, and leave the reason here. A declined
   want with no reason is a want that comes back.

## The standing questions

These are the questions Chief asks when a want is under-specified. They live
here so they get sharper each cycle instead of being reinvented each time.

**What are you doing when you open Personal OS?** The product does three
jobs — interaction, coordination and creation. A want usually serves one of
them. Which one gets the better version of it?

**How much should the factory decide on its own?** Between the owner's
replies, the factory either waits for a go-ahead or proceeds within limits it
was given. This sets the cadence of the whole loop.

**What should the factory build next?** One thing. The next work item is
chosen from what the owner asks for, not from what looks interesting in the
repository.

**What is observably different afterwards?** If the answer is "it feels
nicer", that is a valid reason but it is not a work item. Name the difference:
a screen that shows something, a flow that completes, a failure that no
longer happens.

**What is explicitly not in scope?** The section of the work item that stops
scope creep. It is not optional, and it is usually the hardest part to
write.

## The rules that apply to every want

- One owner per work item.
- Never open a work item twice: post to the group **or** dispatch directly,
  never both.
- Never weaken a gate to make a want affordable.
- A want that changes a published contract needs a migration plan and a
  [CONTRACTS.md](../CONTRACTS.md) update **before** it is scheduled, not
  after.
