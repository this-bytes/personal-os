# Intake — wants, and how they become work

The factory loop in [FACTORY.md](../FACTORY.md) starts at intake. This file is
the intake queue: the wants that have been said out loud and have not yet
become work items.

Chat is where wants arrive. This file is where they are remembered. If a want
is not written here, the factory has not heard it — the same rule as
FACTORY.md: the repository is the state.

A **want** is a request in the owner's words. A **work item** is something one
owner can implement and someone else can verify. Most wants are not work
items. Some are already shipped. Some are three work items. Some are wrong.
Intake is where that is discovered, before anyone spends an hour on it.

## The queue

Empty until the owner says something. A want is written here in the owner's
own words, not a summary of them.

Verdicts: `open` — not yet judged. `accepted` — became a work item, cited
here. `declined` — not doing it, with the reason kept. `folded` — already
covered by an existing work item.

## The stated scope

The owner answered "run within a stated scope" for how much the factory
decides on its own. The scope is this, until the owner says otherwise:

> Improve **interaction** — the owner talking to agents — and make the panel
> answer **"what needs me"** on the landing page. One owner. No permissions,
> no sharing, no onboarding, no migration work.
>
> Inside the scope the factory works continuously and stops only at a
> published boundary: a change to a contract in [CONTRACTS.md](../CONTRACTS.md),
> a change to the dependency set, the lockfile, CI or a release, and anything
> the owner must approve to be externally visible.

W-2 is the reason the scope names interaction rather than coordination. The
"what needs me" page is judged against that: it is the panel helping the owner
talk to agents, not the panel showing a project dashboard. Anything that
serves the coordination view for its own sake is out of scope.

## The strategy decisions, 2026-10-20

Grilled with the owner on 2026-10-20 using Matt Pocock's `grill-me` protocol.
The owner agreed with the recommended answers to Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6, and
corrected Q5. This section is the source of truth for the decisions;
[WI-011](../work/WI-011.md) copies them into the product record.

| #   | Decision                                             | The answer                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q1  | Which ground the product is built on                 | An environment agents operate and extend — not a chat home; the factory is a part of it, not the whole of it                                    |
| Q2  | Does the human ever operate software, or only decide | Only decide: direct, approve, accept. Agents do everything else. Connecting a new agent is a trust decision                                     |
| Q3  | What "native" means for an agent-created feature     | A typed, validated resource in our own contracts, authored through templates                                                                    |
| Q4  | Which two things "everyday productivity" means       | Tasks/work and documents. Not email, not calendar                                                                                               |
| Q5  | What "borrow without depending" means in practice    | **Corrected by the owner:** _"i want to use these as inspriation and then implement into our codebase against our spec"_                        |
| Q6  | What number proves "sustainable and agent-developed" | The share of features authored by agents in-instance, and the share of operations done without the owner touching code; both shown in the panel |

**Sharpened by the research sweep, 2026-10-20.** Twelve comparators, licences
read from the repositories themselves. Three findings change what has to be
written down, and none of them is a decision until the owner says so:

1. **A forming standard carries our authority model.** The MCP Apps extension
   (SEP-1865, proposed 2025-11-21 by MCP core maintainers at OpenAI and
   Anthropic with the MCP-UI creators) lets a server ship UI to a host:
   pre-declared `ui://` templates the host can review before execution,
   communication over plain MCP JSON-RPC so it stays auditable, and hosts able
   to require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls
   ([post](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/)).
   It is a proposal, not a ratified standard, and it requires a text-only
   fallback. The host's approval gate is the part that matters here: it is the
   same shape as "the human decides", and the same shape as our ledger. So
   "native" should mean typed in our contracts _and_ rendered through that
   mechanism — an agent-created dashboard is a first-class resource the host
   can review and gate, not a surface we invent.
2. **The rule behind both working precedents of agent self-extension:** an
   agent-authored artefact does not exist until something has checked it.
   Anthropic's skill-creator authors skills under a typed contract with evals
   ([skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md));
   n8n's MCP server creates real workflows under validate-before-deploy,
   copy-before-edit ([n8n-mcp](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp)). Our
   ledger — goal → task → execution → evidence → acceptance — is that shape
   already.
3. **The licence reality is why Q5 is right.** n8n is Sustainable Use, and its
   licence file says it is "not licensed under any of the main open source
   licenses"; Dify is a modified Apache 2.0 with additional conditions. Both
   verified in the repositories. A licence can change what the product is.
   One hard case is the owner's to decide, not the factory's: **vendoring
   AGPL-3.0 code into this repository changes this project's licence.**

The conformance targets these findings imply — MCP Apps for agent-created UI,
AG-UI for the agent-to-UI event stream — are the recommended answer to the
protocol-boundary question below. They are written down as a recommendation in
[WI-011](../work/WI-011.md), and the question is still open until the owner
answers it.

**Q5 in the doctrine.** The owner's answer is now a rule in
[FACTORY.md](../FACTORY.md): _Borrow the idea, not the dependency._ Another
project is inspiration — we read it, take the approach, and build the feature
inside this repository against our own contracts and data model. We do not
vendor a codebase in, and we do not add a runtime dependency to get a feature.

One boundary rides on it, and it is not settled yet: an **interface** is
conformed to, never reimplemented. Personal OS is a client of ACP, A2A, MCP
and the OpenAI-compatible API shape. "Our spec" means our domain model, not
our dialect of someone else's protocol. That reading is in the doctrine, and it
is being put to the owner in the next grilling round.

**What the decisions unblock.** The landing page becomes an inbox of things
needing authority rather than a directory of screens; the visual direction
([WI-010](../work/WI-010.md)) is judged against the human's role rather than
taste; agent-created features are native resources; and the product reports on
itself with the two measures.

**What two of these decisions still need, checked against the code.** The
identity the owner chose is an environment agents operate _and extend_, and a
product that reports on itself. Both have their data model already, and
neither has a work item.

- **Q3's "authored through templates" — the third half is not built.** Typed:
  six resource kinds in `resourceTypeSchema`. Validated: per-type specs
  (`dashboardSpecSchema`, `documentSpecSchema`, `dataSourceSpecSchema`,
  `memorySpecSchema`) checked by the owning provider's `validate(data)`.
  Templates: there is no template concept for a resource anywhere in the
  product — the only templates in the code are HTTP body templates and prompt
  templates. So an agent can create a resource, and nothing tells it what a
  good one looks like.
- **Q6's two measures — the data is there, nothing counts it.**
  `resources.createdBy` already separates an agent's authorship from the
  owner's (the MCP server writes the agent's connection id), and `auditLog`
  records the actor of every action. Nothing turns either into a number, and
  no work item covers it.

The queue behind these decisions is interaction and truthfulness work. None of
it makes the environment extendable or self-reporting, which is the substance
of the identity the owner chose. The measures are a read-only count and a
band; the template path is real work, and it is the one that makes "agents
extend it" true rather than merely possible.

## The owner's decisions, 2026-10-20 22:34

Chief put four questions to the owner; the owner answered all four. These
are decisions, and this section is where they are kept.

| #   | Question                                                                                                        | Answer                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q1  | Which of the three contract changes do you approve now — the `unknown` state, the persona, the approval resume? | **All three.** Build them, each with its migration plan and its `CONTRACTS.md` entry                              |
| Q2  | The live stream — when?                                                                                         | **After the truthfulness work**: WI-009 first, then whichever contracts are approved. It stays a candidate (C-14) |
| Q3  | Should an agent have memory of its own?                                                                         | **Yes — an agent gets its own memory scope.** [WI-012](../work/WI-012.md)                                         |
| Q4  | Is the approval decision control part of WI-004?                                                                | **Yes.** The control is part of WI-004, not a separate item                                                       |

**What Q1 unblocked.** WI-006, WI-007 and WI-008 move from "stopped at a
published boundary" to approved. The remaining condition on each of them is
the same: `CONTRACTS.md` carries the entry with a migration note, which is
[WI-013](../work/WI-013.md) — Wren's file, so Wren's work.

**What Q2 settled.** The live stream is a candidate, not a work item, and it
sits after the truthfulness work. C-14 records that.

**What Q3 changed.** C-11 was a candidate with the owner's decision pending
against it. The owner has now decided, so C-11 becomes
[WI-012](../work/WI-012.md) — and it is a second published-contract change,
which is why it goes last in the order.

**What Q4 confirmed.** WI-004's criterion already said an approval is
"approved or rejected where the list is". The owner has now confirmed that
the decision control is part of WI-004, so the item cannot be accepted
without it and no separate item is opened for it.

**The brief is reconciled against the repository, 2026-10-20 22:45.** The
MiniMax Bot brief was updated at 21:58 and re-sent; Chief read that version
and reconciled it. Three places where the repository is ahead of the brief,
so nobody re-opens or re-proposes them:

1. **WI-006, WI-007, WI-008 and WI-009 are already open**, sized, assigned
   and dispatched. They are not "ready to open as they stand" — they are
   running.
2. **The brief's §3.1 and TR-5 are superseded by the owner's later
   answers.** §3.1 keeps per-agent memory as a candidate; the owner has
   since decided it is wanted, so it is [WI-012](../work/WI-012.md) — the
   second published-contract change, and last in the order. TR-5 is left to
   Chief; the owner has since decided it comes after the truthfulness work
   and stays candidate C-14.
3. **The brief's WI-004 is stale.** Its front end is not in `implement` — it
   landed at `45c2e54` and is in `verify` with Probe. The sequencing point
   still holds and is already honoured: WI-008 lands before that front end
   is finished.

One question the brief asked Chief is now answered from the published
contract rather than from the owner: **WI-009's "was coordinator mode ever
meant to let any participant hand over?"** `CONTRACTS.md:99-107` lists as a
mandatory routing safeguard that only one owner is responsible for
coordinating a particular delegation, so the code violates a published
contract and the item is dispatchable with no owner answer in the way.

## Candidates

Gaps Chief found in the repository. These are **not** wants. They are
possibilities, and they become work only when the owner picks one or asks for
something that leads to it. Each names where it was seen.

## The order

The four items the MiniMax Bot brief produced are all owned by Cog, and Cog
is one implementer. So the order is not a preference, it is the only thing
that can happen.

**WI-004 → WI-020 + WI-021 → WI-018 → C-14 → WI-017.**

**The order, 2026-10-21 03:30, rewritten because most of the batch landed.**
Between 23:55 and 03:20 the contract batch, the persona, the agent's memory,
the stack check, the coordinator rule and WI-004's decision control all
landed: `5f019b9`, `bf400bd`, `70d042c`, `e764e6a`, `ff15a90`, `3872dbc`,
`a2aadb4`. What is left is the part that was never started.

1. **WI-004** is in flight with Cog. Probe found two criteria unmet — the
   approval row carried no control, and the entry did not say which agent
   was waiting — and both now have implementations in the tree: the control
   (`a2aadb4`), and the agent on the entry, which the client renders by name
   or by id and the server sends as `agentConnectionId`. It is one report
   away from verify.
2. **WI-020** (the product counts what it did) and **WI-021** (a delegation
   addressed to a participant is not silently dropped) are next. WI-020
   waits on the owner's nod for the route; WI-021 waits for WI-009's
   verification, because it is the same file.
3. **WI-018** (the published `WaitingItem` lives in the contracts package)
   comes after WI-004's front end settles, because the shape of a waiting
   item changes while it does. **WI-022** (the published waiting list's
   reasons are missing the one the code emits) is the same published shape,
   and the two are cheaper as one item — one pass over `CONTRACTS.md`, one
   over the type — so they should land together.
4. **C-14**, the live stream, keeps the floor the owner set for it: after the
   truthfulness work and the contracts, and after the inbox, because the
   owner's judgement criterion is the inbox.
5. **WI-017** (the templates) is last among the substance, gated on the
   owner's answers about the template concept and the protocol boundary, not
   on its priority.

**What the 23:55 order said, and why it is superseded.** It was
WI-009 → WI-008 → WI-007 → WI-006 → WI-012, with WI-009 second rather than
first because its dispatch was refused by the runtime's guard and the
contract batch went out without it. It is superseded because that batch
landed, not because the reasoning was wrong: an item that crosses no
published boundary goes first, an item whose window is open goes next, and
an item that depends on another goes after it.

### Chief's adjudications, 2026-10-21 03:30

- **WI-009 — accepted into verify.** Every gate that applies is green with
  the actual output: typecheck, 190 server tests and the rest, format,
  build, smoke. The e2e gate does not apply — no web client changed — and
  the two e2e failures are WI-004's criteria 1 and 5, which were failing
  before this change and are not this item's. No contract change and no
  migration: the published safeguard already says what the behaviour must
  be, and Probe's covering tests were failing before and pass now.
  **One condition on the verification:** Cog changed the owner's own message
  in coordinator mode — it now reaches the coordinator even when it names a
  participant — and no test pins it. The behaviour is accepted, because it
  makes the mode's published promise true and matches how a mention already
  behaved. The gap is the missing test, so Probe's verification must pin it
  or the item returns.
- **WI-009's second finding is now WI-021.** The MCP tool's
  `targetParticipantIds` argument is matched against agent connection ids, so
  a client passing real participant ids has them silently dropped. That is a
  published-argument defect, not a taste question, and it is a work item now.
- **WI-011 — Wren's report accepted, and the two additions stay.** The
  conversation question is in scope: it is question six of the six the ADR
  has to list, WI-004's own criterion refers to it, and the ADR is the
  record of what is open. The record that said four questions where there
  were six was a plain error, and it is corrected. The item is in review:
  the product record and ADR 0007 landed, and Probe's verification is owed.
  The verification dispatch was refused twice by the runtime's
  task-assignment gate and was **delivered on the retry at 03:40** — task
  `task_e2219b4e3c7a`, batch `batch_4a96612a2eaa`, request id
  `wi-011-probe-review-2026-10-21`, so the retry was idempotent rather than
  a second worker.
- **WI-004's verification is dispatched to Probe, 03:42** — request
  `wi-004-probe-reverify-2026-10-21`. The item is in review with the
  implementation landed in `a2aadb4`, and both of Probe's two failing
  criteria now have implementations: the control, and the agent on the entry
  (the client renders the agent by name or by id, and the server sends
  `agentConnectionId`). This verification is the one that unblocks the
  `npm run test:e2e` gate, which was red only because of this item. The
  dispatch is recorded here and not in the item's own file, because the other
  Chief session is the lead on that file; the rule that a claim is the item's
  dispatch record is honoured by this note, and it is said out loud in the
  group.

**The two decisions that had no work item behind them, 2026-10-20 23:55.** C-19
and C-20 are not candidates. They are the unfunded halves of decisions the
owner already made: Q3's third half — "authored through templates" — and Q6 —
"the product reports on itself". A decision with nothing behind it is a wish,
and FACTORY.md now says so.

- **C-20 → [WI-020](../work/WI-020.md)** — the product counts what it did.
  Sized, and waiting on the owner's nod: a read-only route is a published
  contract.
- **C-19 → [WI-017](../work/WI-017.md)** — a template tells an agent what a
  good resource looks like. Sized, and waiting on the owner's nod: a template
  in the resource model is a published concept, and the way templates reach
  agents depends on the protocol-boundary answer below.

**The questions waiting on the owner, 2026-10-20 23:55.** Six, and each one is
a word or a sentence. Chief's recommendations are in brackets.

1. **The direction — Desk (B)?** [B] One word. The adoption item and the
   home's layout wait on it; the decision control does not.
2. **The measures route.** Q6 needs somewhere for the two numbers to come
   from. Approve one read-only route, same auth as everything else? [yes]
3. **The template concept.** Approve a resource-template registry in the
   published model, reached by agents through our own MCP surface? [yes]
4. **Reversibility.** With one owner there is no second operator to absorb a
   bad action, so authority without reversibility is exposure. Is it a
   product principle that the owner's decisions are reversible? [yes]
5. **The protocol boundary.** The panel's agent-facing surface conforms to
   MCP and AG-UI; ACP and A2A are the agent-connection side, which we speak
   when we connect out to an agent. Our resources, tasks and goals stay ours,
   and no protocol is forked. [yes]
6. **Can a conversation wait on the owner's reply?** Today the data model
   cannot: `WaitingKind` is `approval | task`, and no contract carries a
   state for a conversation waiting on a person. If yes, it is a third kind of
   entry, a contract change, and the clause in WI-004's criterion that says
   "an entry that needs a reply opens the conversation it belongs to" becomes
   real instead of vacuous. [yes — an agent asking its owner a question is
   the most direct form of talking to agents]

7. **WI-009** (coordinator-only handoff) is first because it crosses no
   published boundary, so it needs no approval and no contract entry. It is
   also the smallest. Chief answered its one open question from
   `CONTRACTS.md:99-107` — it is a defect against a published mandatory
   safeguard, not a contract change.
8. **WI-008** (outcome unknown) is second because it is the smallest of the
   contract changes, because its window is open _now_ — WI-004's front end
   is held, so landing it before that front end is finished avoids a second
   pass over the waiting list — and because WI-007's last criterion depends
   on it.
9. **WI-007** (approval resumes the turn) is third because it is the clearest
   interaction defect there is, and because it needs the `unknown` state to
   finish its last criterion.
10. **WI-006** (persona) is fourth because it is the largest item, and
    because one of its display criteria touches WI-004's front end, which is
    still held.
11. **WI-012** (an agent's own memory) is last because it is a second
    published-contract change, and because an agent's memory only means
    something once the agent has a role.

**The owner's answer put the live stream after this batch.** C-14 — one live
SSE connection with a per-chat cursor instead of a 250 ms poll — stays a
candidate, and it comes after WI-009 and the approved contracts. It is not a
work item, and it does not enter the queue.

**WI-013** (Wren) is the one item that is not Cog's: it writes the four
`CONTRACTS.md` entries and their migration notes, and each of the four code
items carries "the contract entry exists" as an acceptance criterion. The
authority runs one way — the published contract is the truth and the code is
checked against it.

**The capacity finding, said out loud.** This batch adds four implementation
items to one implementer, on top of WI-002 in verify and WI-004 on hold.
Cog cannot start any of them until the tree is clean of the items already in
flight, and one implementer means one item at a time. Sizing a brief is
therefore not just writing the items — it is saying which one starts first
and what does not start yet. `FACTORY.md` now carries that as a rule.

**The tree is the other constraint, and it is not mine to fix.** As of
2026-10-20 22:20 the working tree is red, and every red line belongs to
another item: `scripts/verify-bundle-size.ts` has two type errors at lines
190 and 195 (WI-005's verifier work, in flight), and `scripts/smoke.ts` plus
`ownerPasswordRecovery.test.ts` carry uncommitted changes from WI-002 and
WI-005. `npm run format:check` is green; `npm run typecheck` is not.

So the order of landing, before anything new starts:

1. **Landed, 2026-10-20 23:30.** Probe's WI-005 work —
   `scripts/verify-stack.ts` and `apps/server/src/__tests__/verifyStack.test.ts`
   — which Probe deliberately left uncommitted because another session was in
   the tree. Chief lands it, path-limited, so the attribution stays honest.
2. **Landed, 2026-10-20 23:30.** Probe's WI-002 verification —
   `scripts/smoke.ts` and `apps/server/src/__tests__/ownerPasswordExposure.test.ts`
   (named `ownerPasswordRecovery.test.ts` before it was renamed) — and Wren's
   documentation rewrite: `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRACTS.md`,
   `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Three owners' finished work, three path-limited
   commits, each credited to its author.
3. **WI-002 closes** — but not on the verification alone. Probe's verification
   is red on two of its four assertions: the exposure is real, and neither
   `CONTRACTS.md` nor `README.md` says what it costs. The fix is
   [WI-014](../work/WI-014.md), owner Wren. WI-014 lands, the four assertions
   pass, WI-002 closes, and only then does WI-009 start.

**Two items that are not Cog's entered the queue tonight**, and neither is in
the batch above:

- [WI-014](../work/WI-014.md) — the documentation says what the password
  recovery costs. Owner Wren. It waits on nothing, but it shares
  `CONTRACTS.md` with WI-013, so the two are done one after the other.
- [WI-015](../work/WI-015.md) — `verify:stack` must work against a deployment
  that already has an owner. Owner Probe. It is a defect in the gate WI-005
  delivered, found by the clean-checkout run. It did not hold WI-005 back,
  because none of WI-005's acceptance criteria turn on it.

**Probe is verifying WI-004 right now** (task `task_2144ce541299`, started
23:12 +11:00), so the tree is red in three places that are not defects:
`apps/web/e2e/waiting-list.spec.ts` and
`apps/server/src/__tests__/waiting-list.test.ts` are Probe's in-flight work,
and `apps/web/e2e/scratch-diag.spec.ts` is a diagnostic scratch file Probe
marked for deletion after the run. It is what `npm run format:check` is
complaining about. Chief has left all three alone.

WI-009 is the first new item to run, because it is the only one of the four
that crosses no published boundary. The other three stop at the owner's
approval of a contract change, and that is the factory behaving correctly
rather than stalling.

The MiniMax Bot plugin is a reference implementation, not a feature to copy.
Some of it is deliberately left out, and the reason is kept so none of it
comes back as a surprise:

| Not translated                                                  | Why                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Groups, members, admins, reply modes, bot creation and deletion | The instance has one owner. No teams, no sharing, no permissions (C-07, W-4). Importing it would import a multi-user product.                                                             |
| Avatars, skins, colours                                         | Cosmetic. They buy nothing for one owner who knows their own agents.                                                                                                                      |
| Message reactions, per-agent usage statistics                   | Cosmetic. Not interaction (C-13).                                                                                                                                                         |

| The `start_helper` background-job model                         | The worker already owns background execution, with leases and reaping.                                                                                                                    |
| Per-agent memory scope, for now                                 | A second published-contract change, and the owner excluded it from the persona decision (C-11).                                                                                           |

## The borrowing rule, applied to this brief

The owner's rule, set 2026-10-20: **borrow the idea, not the dependency.**
Another project is inspiration — read it, take the approach, and build the
feature inside this repository against our own contracts, schemas and data
model. No vendored codebase, no runtime dependency.

The MiniMax Bot brief is the first thing this rule has to be applied to, and
it is worth writing the audit down rather than asserting it.

| Item                                            | What is borrowed                                                              | What is ours                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [WI-006](../work/WI-006.md) persona             | the idea that an agent is a named role with standing instructions             | the `Persona` type, the override, the resolver and the turn-context injection are all ours, in our contracts                                   |
| [WI-007](../work/WI-007.md) approval resumes    | the idea that deciding an approval continues the turn                         | the gate is our own `persistentSessions` capability and our own ACP adapter — the ACP interface is **conformed to, never reimplemented**       |
| [WI-008](../work/WI-008.md) outcome unknown     | the idea that "we don't know" is not "failed"                                 | three enum additions, a state machine, an audit transition, in our contracts                                                                   |
| [WI-009](../work/WI-009.md) coordinator handoff | nothing — it is a defect against a safeguard `CONTRACTS.md` already published | the whole thing                                                                                                                                |
| C-11 per-agent memory                           | the idea that an agent can have memory of its own                             | the plugin's `self/team/bot` scope enum is **not** imported; the idea has to be expressed in our own `workspace \| conversation \| goal` model |

One boundary rides on the rule and it is not settled: an **interface** is
conformed to, never reimplemented. Personal OS is a client of ACP, A2A, MCP
and the OpenAI-compatible API shape. "Our spec" means our domain model, not
our dialect of someone else's protocol.

## How a want becomes a work item

1. **Record it in the owner's words.** Not a paraphrase. The owner's phrasing
   often carries the real requirement, and the paraphrase is where it gets
   lost.
2. **Judge it.** Is it worth doing at all? Is it already shipped? Is it a
   duplicate of an open work item? Answer that here, in one line.
3. **Sharpen it with the standing questions.** Only the ones whose answers
   change the work. A question that does not change the work item is noise.
4. **Split it.** One owner per work item. A want that needs two owners is two
   work items (FACTORY.md).
5. **Write the work item** in `.factory/work/WI-NNN.md`, in the format of
   [TASK.md](TASK.md). The acceptance criteria are written so that someone who
   has not read the diff could check them.
6. **Or decline it**, with the reason, and leave the reason here. A declined
   want with no reason is a want that comes back.

## The standing questions

These are the questions Chief asks when a want is under-specified. They live
here so they get sharper each cycle instead of being reinvented each time.

**What are you doing when you open Personal OS?** The product does three
jobs — interaction, coordination and creation. A want usually serves one of
them. Which one gets the better version of it?

**How much should the factory decide on its own?** Between the owner's
replies, the factory either waits for a go-ahead or proceeds within limits it
was given. This sets the cadence of the whole loop.

**What should the factory build next?** One thing. The next work item is
chosen from what the owner asks for, not from what looks interesting in the
repository.

**Which visual direction does the panel take?** Four directions are built as
prototypes in `prototypes/` and none of them has been chosen. The landing page
(WI-004) is written in the current design language, so a direction chosen
afterwards means rewriting its front end. Deciding late costs a rewrite;
deciding early costs nothing that has been built, because the server side of
WI-004 does not depend on the visual language. **[WI-010](../work/WI-010.md)**
prepares the recommendation against the owner's own wants, so the question
comes back to the owner with an answer attached rather than as an open topic.

**What is observably different afterwards?** If the answer is "it feels
nicer", that is a valid reason but it is not a work item. Name the difference:
a screen that shows something, a flow that completes, a failure that no
longer happens.

**What is explicitly not in scope?** The section of the work item that stops
scope creep. It is not optional, and it is usually the hardest part to
write.

## The rules that apply to every want

- One owner per work item.
- **Every new feature is grilled with the owner before it becomes a work
  item.** The owner's rule, 2026-10-20: _"dont rush to implement a feature
  when we havent discussed it."_ The grilling is Matt Pocock's `grill-me`,
  installed at `~/.minimax/skills/grill-me` and `~/.minimax/skills/grilling`
  (MIT, © 2026 Matt Pocock). It asks in rounds: each round is the whole
  frontier of settled questions, every question carries a recommended
  answer, facts are looked up rather than asked for, and the decisions belong
  to the owner. A work item does not open until the frontier is settled and
  the owner has confirmed the shared understanding.
- Never open a work item twice: post to the group **or** dispatch directly,
  never both.
- Never weaken a gate to make a want affordable.
- A want that changes a published contract needs a migration plan and a
  [CONTRACTS.md](../CONTRACTS.md) update **before** it is scheduled, not
  after.

**Chief may hold; only the owner releases.** When the owner asks for a
strategy discussion, Chief holds the items in flight, records the hold and
the findings in the work item, and opens nothing new. The queue moves when
the owner says so.

## The tiebreak: the decision control lands before the theme, 2026-10-20 23:30

The Desk theme (the direction in C-09) and WI-004's decision control both
touch the panel, and one of them has to go first so the palette is not paid
for twice. **Chief decides this, and the answer is: the control first, then
the theme.** The reasoning, out loud:

- **The control is in flight.** Probe is verifying WI-004 right now (task
  `task_2144ce541299`, started 23:12 +11:00). An item in flight owns the tree
  until it lands, and reversing the order would throw away a verification that
  is already running.
- **A palette pass over the finished panel costs one pass either way.** If the
  theme lands after the control, the theme covers the control too, so the
  panel is painted once, at the end, in its final shape. If the theme landed
  first, the control would have to be painted again by hand afterwards.
- **The theme could not start first in any case.** It needs the direction
  confirmed, and that question is already with the owner in the strategy
  chat (C-09) — one word: **Desk (B)**, **A**, **C** or **D**.

So the order is: WI-004's control lands, then the theme, once the owner has
confirmed the direction. Nothing here needs the owner to decide: sequencing
and capacity are Chief's job, and asking would be punting it to the person
who has the least context for it.

**The visual direction itself is still the owner's**, and it is still
pending. Chief has a recommendation and a reason for it; the choice between
four built prototypes is a product decision, and the owner's rule is that the
queue moves when the owner says so.

## Owed, 2026-10-21 01:08

The status post for this round was **refused twice** — the `Personal OS
Factory` group is mid-discussion, and the 23:40 post (`task_70c6057c13ae`) is
still queued behind it. A post that was never sent is not a message, so it is
recorded here and delivered from here when the round clears.

## The state at 2026-10-21 03:30 — the gates are green

**Every gate is green for the first time.** Measured by Chief on the tree at
`a2aadb4`:

| Gate                   | Result                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run typecheck`    | exit 0                                                                                    |
| `npm run test`         | exit 0 — server 190 passed (21 files), web 46, worker 23, agent-adapters 16, contracts 28 |
| `npm run format:check` | exit 0                                                                                    |
| `npm run build`        | exit 0                                                                                    |
| `npm run test:e2e`     | exit 0 — 24 passed                                                                        |

**The two reds that were carried are gone.** Both were real, and both were
fixed by a concurrent session while Chief was measuring them:

- `npm run test` was red on two files, both Probe's tests proving WI-009's
  defect. `3872dbc` ("Keep the coordinator rule on the path that names a
  target") closed the gap — the explicit-target path had been applied
  _before_ the routing mode was consulted. Chief ran the two files
  directly: `Test Files 2 passed (2)`, `Tests 24 passed (24)`.
- `npm run test:e2e` was red on two of Probe's browser tests, both
  specifying WI-004's missing control. `a2aadb4` ("Let the owner decide an
  approval where the list is") delivered it.

**Chief's standing rules, restated because they were both nearly broken
again:**

- _Never merge without the gates green._ The branch carried two reds for
  hours. Chief did not merge, and did not weaken a gate to clear them.
- _One file, one live item._ Chief wrote a new work item over the top of
  another session's live WI-021 and clobbered it. It was restored from
  `HEAD` unchanged and Chief's item took the next free number, WI-022. This
  is the **second** collision of this kind in this factory — WI-016 was the
  first, and WI-020 carries the renumber note from it. Chief's own item
  number was the cause this time, not a filename.

## The findings Chief made while the gates were green

The gates being green made it worth asking what the **published contract**
now says against what the **code** now does. Two real defects came out of
it, and neither is a gate:

1. **[WI-013](work/WI-013.md) — returned to Wren.** All four contract
   entries say _"The code does not implement it yet"_ — and the code
   implements all four (`9ad4f98`, `70d042c`, `5f019b9`, `e764e6a`). One of
   them, WI-008's, was **already false when it was written**: Chief checked
   with `git merge-base --is-ancestor 9ad4f98 5a7e620` (exit 0, so the
   implementation was already in the tree) and read the tree at `5a7e620`,
   which carries `'unknown'` in `messageStatusSchema`.
2. **[WI-022](work/WI-022.md) — opened.** `CONTRACTS.md:632` publishes
   `WaitingReason = 'pending' | 'review' | 'blocked'` and
   `apps/server/src/api/waiting.ts:17` declares a fourth member,
   `'unknown'`. A published type the code has outgrown. WI-008's own commit
   message named this gap and left it — a gap named in a commit message and
   left there is a gap with no one holding it.

## The post that is owed, request id `status-2026-10-21-0105`

The earlier post, superseded by the one below. Kept because it is the record
of what was owed at the time:

- WI-004 returns to implement — Probe's verification says it fails criterion 5
  (an approval is approved or rejected in the list) and the "who is waiting"
  half of criterion 1. Dispatched to Cog, `task_4bafb60edd39`.
- WI-009 implemented and committed (`6e7d347`), with Probe for verification,
  `task_1c40cabe1df4`. WI-008 implemented and committed (`9ad4f98`), with
  Probe for verification, `task_8bb9dbcfbeaa`.
- WI-013's four published contract entries are landed (`5a7e620`). WI-002 and
  WI-014 are accepted.
- The gates, measured on the tree with everything landed: `npm run typecheck`
  exit 0; `npm run test` 160 passed (160) in 17 files, plus 46, 11, 13, 13;
  `npm run format:check` exit 0. The one red gate left is `npm run test:e2e`,
  on exactly two tests Probe wrote on purpose to specify WI-004's missing
  control.
- Two corrections: Wren's WI-013 work was landed path-limited as `5a7e620`
  because a bare commit in this tree sweeps other people's work; and the
  remote already exists — `origin` is
  `https://github.com/this-bytes/personal-os.git`, pushed 21:47 +11:00 — so
  the owner is not asked to create a repository.

## The state at 2026-10-21 04:00 — the suite is red again, and the red is the specification

**Probe reviewed WI-008 and the item does not meet its criteria.** Task
`task_8bb9dbcfbeaa`, batch `batch_d6dc904088cd`. The `unknown` state is real
and it reaches the owner correctly, but on two of the three paths an
`unknown` outcome still becomes a retry — the one thing this item exists to
prevent.

**The suite is red at `1cafe35`, on purpose.** Probe's new tests are the
specification of what is left, and they are committed. Chief measured the
tree:

```
npm run test → FAIL (exit 1)
  server:         Test Files 1 failed | 20 passed (21)   Tests 2 failed | 190 passed (192)
  web:            Test Files 5 passed (5)                 Tests 46 passed (46)
  worker:         Test Files 1 failed | 4 passed (5)      Tests 6 failed | 24 passed (30)
  agent-adapters: Test Files 2 passed (2)                 Tests 16 passed (16)
  contracts:      Test Files 4 passed (4)                 Tests 28 passed (28)
```

Eight failures, all of them the retry paths, the contract's waiting reason and
the audit trail. Nothing else is red. Chief's rule stands: the contract is the
truth and the code is the defect — so the tests stay, and the code moves.
WI-008 is returned to Cog, task `task_21b395d2f98a`, batch
`batch_44d6112553e4`.

**Chief confirmed all five of Probe's defects against the tree** before
passing them to Cog. They are in [WI-008](work/WI-008.md): the factory-task
and automation paths test `failure` before `unknown`
(`apps/worker/src/executor.ts:811-815`, `:1002-1006`); the reaper requeues a
job whose item is already `unknown`; the panel gates its accept/reject
control on `review`, so an unknown task cannot be closed by the owner at all;
and leaving `unknown` by assigning the task to an agent writes no audit entry.

### Two duplicate dispatches, cancelled

Two Chief sessions in one tree dispatched WI-004 and WI-011 to Probe twice.
Probe is the only verifier, the queue is deep, and a second worker in one
worktree is what the runtime's own guard warns about. **Chief cancelled his
own two tasks** — `task_4a566d42c121` (WI-004) and `task_f5b5eb99dea3`
(WI-011). The live verifications are `task_616009728104` (WI-004) and
`task_e2219b4e3c7a` (WI-011). One verifier, one item, one verification.

### The routing file went red too — `a7e39e9`

While the factory waited, Probe committed `a7e39e9`: two test files, +211
lines, no source change, and three of the tests are red. They split across two
items — one is WI-009's (the sender is resolved by believing the message) and
two are WI-021's (a named target is dropped before the rule ever sees it).
The file is claimed by WI-009, which is older, so WI-021 waits and the two
findings go to Cog in one dispatch. The details are in
[WI-009](work/WI-009.md).

### The gates at `0732b41`

```
npm run typecheck    → exit 0
npm run test         → exit 1
  server:          Test Files 3 failed | 18 passed (21)   Tests 5 failed | 199 passed (204)
  web:             Test Files 5 passed (5)                 Tests 46 passed (46)
  worker:          Test Files 1 failed | 4 passed (5)      Tests 6 failed | 24 passed (30)
  agent-adapters:  Test Files 2 passed (2)                 Tests 16 passed (16)
  contracts:       Test Files 4 passed (4)                 Tests 28 passed (28)
npm run format:check → exit 0 — All matched files use Prettier code style!
npm run build       → exit 0 — ✓ built in 3.28s
npm run test:e2e    → exit 0 — 24 passed (46.8s)
```

Eleven reds, all of them Probe's specifications: eight for WI-008, three for
WI-009 and WI-021. Nothing else is red, and the browser suite is green — so
the e2e gate, which was the one holding the owner's top want, is now satisfied.

### A want, not a work item — the number space has one owner

`automationRunStatusSchema` (`packages/contracts/src/automation.ts:73`) gained
`'unknown'`, and `CONTRACTS.md` publishes no automation run status at all — so
nothing contradicts it and nothing records it either. It came out of Probe's
WI-008 review. It is recorded here rather than as a numbered item, because
`fff389e` gave the number space one owner and the other session proposes wants
in this file.

- **Title:** The published contract says nothing about the automation run
  status.
- **Owner:** Wren.
- **Criteria:** `CONTRACTS.md` publishes the automation run status, including
  `'unknown'` and what it means on a run; the entry says what a client must do
  with a value it did not expect; the entry is checked against
  `packages/contracts/src/automation.ts:73` by the reviewer.
- **Not urgent:** nothing contradicts it, and no client depends on it today.

### The post that is owed, request id `status-2026-10-21-0415`

The group post could not be delivered. `post_group` answered **"The group is
mid-discussion; post again once this round finishes"** on every attempt
between 04:15 and 04:30 — the other Chief session has a round in flight, and
the group's own guard holds the door until it closes. The request id makes the
retry idempotent rather than a second post, so it is recorded here and sent
when the round ends.

The post says, in one line per work item, newest first: WI-023 triage,
blocked on the push path; WI-022 triage, waiting on the owner's nod, with
Probe's confirmation and the added urgency-order criterion; WI-021 triage, the
defect proven and the file held by WI-009; WI-020 and WI-017 waiting on the
owner's nod; WI-018, WI-013 returned to Wren, WI-012, WI-011, WI-010, WI-009,
WI-007, WI-006, WI-004 in the state their ledgers say; WI-015 accepted, and
what the product can now do because of it; and the five questions that are
with the owner.

It carries the gates at `5f91e19` — typecheck 0, test 1 with eleven reds,
format:check 0, build 0, test:e2e 0 with 24 passed — and the line that the
eleven reds are Probe's specification rather than a regression. It also names
the two duplicate dispatches that were cancelled and the fact that the
automation-run-status gap is recorded as a want rather than a numbered item.

**Nothing in the post dispatches anything.** Every item with work in flight
was dispatched before the post was written, and the post names no agent, so
no bot is woken by it.

### A second want, from the second Chief session — WI-010's two stale facts

The second Chief session re-verified `prototypes/DIRECTION.md` independently,
from the tree, and recorded the check in [WI-010](work/WI-010.md). The
recommendation holds: the central number is exact —

```
git grep -c -E 'slate-|indigo-' 235f97c -- 'apps/web/src' 'packages/ui/src'
  → lines=224  files=31
```

— which is what the document claims, reproduced with the document's own
command, and every substrate claim it makes was checked against the tree. Two
facts have since moved, because the tree moved: the control landed in
`a2aadb4`, so "nothing under `apps/web` calls `POST /api/approvals/:id/decide`"
is now false, and the palette cost is 244 lines across 34 files at HEAD rather
than 224 across 31. The document is pinned to `235f97c` and says so, so this is
staleness rather than error — but it is recorded as a want, because the number
space has one owner and it is not this session's.

- **Title:** WI-010's recommendation is pinned to a commit the tree has left
  behind.
- **Owner:** Vision. `prototypes/DIRECTION.md` is a design artefact and
  WI-010's own tiebreak says it is Vision's to write.
- **Criteria:** the document is re-verified against the commit it is pinned to
  and says which one that is; the sentence about
  `POST /api/approvals/:id/decide` is corrected — the call is at
  `apps/web/src/components/WaitingList.tsx:99`, with approve and reject at
  `:249` and `:257`; the palette cost is re-measured and carries the commit it
  was measured at, with the command that reproduces it
  (`git grep -c -E 'slate-|indigo-' -- 'apps/web/src' 'packages/ui/src'` — 244
  lines across 34 files at `0732b41`); and the recommendation itself does not
  change, because B was recommended on the owner's own Q2 answer and the
  control landing strengthens rather than weakens the conclusion that the
  control is not blocked by the direction.
- **Not urgent:** the owner reads one word, not a cost model, and the ADR that
  records the answer is written after the owner confirms.

### The status post that is owed, request id `status-2026-10-21-0430`

The 04:30 status post to the `Personal OS Factory` group was refused by the
runtime, not by the group: _"This Bot is replying in multiple chats, so this
tool call cannot be assigned safely."_ The same refusal came back for every
task query, so this session could not read the state of the six verifications
now with Probe either, and could not accept or return any of them.

The post that is owed, request id `status-2026-10-21-0430`, says: WI-010
verified independently and holding, with its two facts now behind the tree;
WI-004's decision control shipped in `a2aadb4` and the browser suite is green
at 24 passed; WI-008 returned to Cog with five defects, because an unknown
outcome still becomes a retry on two of three paths; WI-009 and WI-021's
findings with Cog in one dispatch; WI-013 returned to Wren; the suite red on
purpose, eleven failures, all of them Probe's specifications; and the
bottleneck, which is one verifier, six items at verify or review, and no
acceptance step happening.

It also carries a tiebreak, said out loud: on WI-004's return, the approval
row keeps its title link to the conversation, with Approve and Reject beside
it. The criterion asks for both — an approval is decided where the list is,
and an entry that needs a reply opens its conversation — and the link is the
context for deciding, not a way out of deciding.

**Superseded.** The 04:30 post is overtaken by the 05:10 post: ten of the
eleven deliberate reds are now green, the fixes for WI-008 and WI-009 landed,
and the one red left is a published-type change that is the owner's to make.
